# TicTacToe_AI
This is a project for my Intro to Artificial Intelligence. This version of tic-tac-toe uses numbers instead of Xs and Os. The winner completes a row summing up to 15. The computer uses the minimax algorithm to decide its next move. 

There is an unresolved issue with the creation of the tree of moves, but it still works.
